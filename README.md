# clvm_custom_mutator
This is my python custom mutator which I used to fuzz the ChiaLisp Virtual Machine (CLVM https://chialisp.com/clvm/)

## Todo:

- Mutate branches instead of just leaves (aka mutate cons pairs in addition to atoms) ( )
- Improve performance ( )
- Add more intelligence in choosing the new atom values (aka add operators instead of random values) ( )
